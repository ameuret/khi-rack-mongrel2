# rack-mongrel2

This Gem was supposed to be "the only Mongrel2 Rack handler you'll ever need." Unfortunately, its original author hasn't done a lot of work with Mongrel2 or Ã˜MQ, so parts of it made ridiculous assumptions which just didn't work in actual production environments. He also seems to be pretty lazy about fixing obvious bugs which make the Gem flat out unusable, so here's a fork.
