= rack-mongrel2

The only Mongrel2 Rack handler you'll ever need.

I wrote this because I wanted to learn Mongrel2, and I didn't like what was out there. I copy-pasted a lot of code from Colin Curtin's m2r project (http://github.com/perplexes/m2r), but I also changed and reorganized it into what I believe is a good setup for a proper rubygem. I used the ruby zmq library instead of the ffi version, so we'll see how that works out.

== How to use

1. Get mongrel2 installed (http://mongrel2.org/wiki?name=GettingStarted)
2. Get your config for mongrel2 setup (see example directory)
3. Add it to your Gemfile

    gem 'rack-mongrel2', '~> 0.1.0', :require => nil

4. Run Mongrel2
5. Run your rails application

    RACK_MONGREL2_UUID=<my uuid> rails s Mongrel2

6. Profit!

I'll write a better blog post soon...

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
